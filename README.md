# smileyfaces_analysis
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for conducting exploratory analysis on an emoticon dataset comprising happy, sad, and neutral faces.  This repository provides a structured framework  to gain practical experience in data analysis and machine learning through hands-on exercises and implementations.


 Part 1: Data Analysis and Bayes Nets

- Visualized and explored the dataset to gain insights into data attributes and guide feature selection.
- Conducted analysis on the dataset, addressing missing values, errors, and outliers as applicable.
- Implemented the Naïve Bayes Classifier and recorded major performance metrics.
- Analyzed correlating features/attributes and formed subsets for further experimentation.
- Ran Naïve Bayes classifier on resulting subsets and drew conclusions from the experiments.

Part 2: Clustering

- Utilized k-means clustering to identify clusters within the dataset.
- Explored different clustering algorithms and evaluated their performance.
- Investigated methods to determine the optimal number of clusters and their impact on clustering accuracy.
- Compared the results of Bayesian classification with clustering algorithms.

 Part 3: Supervised Learning: Generalization & Overfitting; Decision Trees

- Created test sets and utilized Decision trees (J48 algorithm) for classification tasks.
- Evaluated classifier performance using cross-validation and separate training/testing sets.
- Explored various decision tree parameters and analyzed their influence on classifier performance.
- Investigated the effects of classifier overfitting through experimentation.

Part 4: Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks

- Employed Linear classifier and Multilayer Perceptron for classification tasks.
- Experimented with various Neural Network parameters to analyze their impact on performance.
- Investigated the complexity of the dataset and the generalization capacity of deep neural networks.
- Explored Convolutional Neural Networks and compared their performance with other machine learning algorithms.
